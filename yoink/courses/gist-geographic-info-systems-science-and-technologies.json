    "GIST 220 — Cartography and Visualization": "Course: GIST 220 — Cartography and Visualization\nCredits: 5\nDescription: Theory, practice, and principles of cartography. Technical introduction to graphic representation and visualization of geographic information. Lectures cover compilation and classification of geospatial datasets, the role of scale and projections in thematic maps, and theory and practice in cartographic symbolization, visualization, and communication.\nRequirements: Requirements Prerequisite(s): ENVS 215A and ENVS 215B and ENVS 215C . Enrollment is restricted to GIST graduate students.",
    "GIST 230 — Remote Sensing": "Course: GIST 230 — Remote Sensing\nCredits: 5\nDescription: Remote sensing is the study of the Earth's land, water, atmospheric and human-made features using imaging devices on both airborne and spaceborne platforms. The course includes the study of electromagnetic energy and the methods used to extract useful information from remotely sensed images. Students develop a strong understanding of the tools and techniques used to display, process, and analyze remotely sensed data as well as develop analytical workflows to derive remotely sensed products for a broad range of applications. Lab work involves image interpretation using aerial photographs and computer-based digital image processing.\nRequirements: Requirements Enrollment is restricted to graduate students enrolled in the GISTAR M.A. Program.",
    "GIST 240 — GIS Development and Programming": "Course: GIST 240 — GIS Development and Programming\nCredits: 5\nDescription: Introduction to the foundational concepts, techniques, and skills of computer programming needed to tackle complex analyses and automate geoprocessing workflows in a geographic information system (GIS). Emphasis is on object-oriented programming and developing basic programming skills using the Python scripting language. Students learn essential programming concepts needed for processing spatial data variables and expressions, data typing, data structures, conditional branching, looping, functions, input/output, data manipulation, and debugging. Students also develop geoprocessing programs to edit, query, manipulate, and analyze spatial data (both vector and raster data) with ArcPy and other modules like NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas. No prior programming experience is required.\nRequirements: Requirements Enrollment is restricted to graduate students enrolled in the Geographic Info Systems, Science, & Technologies program.",
    "GIST 250 — Geospatial Technology Applications": "Course: GIST 250 — Geospatial Technology Applications\nCredits: 5\nDescription: Variable-subject course focused on specific systems such as 3D/CAD systems and drone technologies, field-based advanced GPS and surveying systems, and server/infrastructure development and management. As a variable subject course, objectives vary depending on the specified subject.\nRequirements: Requirements Enrollment is restricted to graduate students enrolled in the Geographic Info Systems, Science, & Technologies program.",
    "GIST 290A — GISTAR Capstone Project": "Course: GIST 290A — GISTAR Capstone Project\nCredits: 10\nDescription: Independent research course during which students work closely with faculty advisors toconduct applied geospatial research. Provides experience in geospatial research, applications, and analysis.\nRequirements: Requirements Enrollment is restricted to GIST graduate students.",
    "GIST 290B — GISTAR Capstone Project": "Course: GIST 290B — GISTAR Capstone Project\nCredits: 10\nDescription: Independent research course during which students work closely with faculty advisors to conduct applied geospatial research. Provides experience in geospatial research, applications, and analysis.\nRequirements: Requirements Enrollment is restricted to GIST graduate students."
