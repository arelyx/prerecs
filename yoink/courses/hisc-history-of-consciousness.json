But most people need care, feel they care, or encounter care in one way or another. Caring can feel good, and also awful; it can do good but also be used to control or hurt others. Care can be rigged by inequalities, and power. Care is complicated, but also vital to people, non-humans, and the planet. It matters what happens with care, when we care, and if we donât.

Democracy can pose a threat to capital accumulation when an accelerated rise in asset values deepens historical inequality; financial markets can pre-empt such threats by becoming suddenly illiquid, thereby bringing on an event of disaccumulation unless/until restoring the confidence that capital markets have in their own continuing appreciation becomes the highest political priority of the state.

Amid anxieties for the planetâs future, we give attention to tensions between place-based ecological attachments and the perpetuation of nativist and nationalist exclusions, and to how Earth, land, and soil world-makings may appear uneven, unequal and divergent, common and uncommon, as well as inevitably interdependent.\nRequirements: Requirements Enrollment is restricted to graduate students.",
