    "ESCI 30 — Biological Principles of Environmental Sciences": "Course: ESCI 30 — Biological Principles of Environmental Sciences\nCredits: 5\nDescription: Introduction to biology and ecology for environmental sciences, focusing on the role of biological organisms within the Earth system. Topics span molecular/organismal interactions, such as photosynthesis and respiration, to global biogeochemical cycles including the role of microbes, net community production, and contaminant distributions.\nRequirements: No additional requirements listed.",
    "ESCI 100A — Fundamentals of Environmental Sciences": "Course: ESCI 100A — Fundamentals of Environmental Sciences\nCredits: 5\nDescription: Introduces fundamental concepts for quantitative analysis of environmental problems and their application to complex systems focusing on algebraic tools. Key concepts include box models, mass and energy balances (including chemical processes), turning word problems into mathematical statements, and estimation. (Formerly offered as Introduction to Environmental Sciences.)\nRequirements: Requirements Prerequisite(s): MATH 11A or MATH 19A , CHEM 3B or CHEM 4B or CHEM 1A , and PHYS 6A or PHYS 5A . Enrollment is restricted to environmental sciences majors.",
    "ESCI 100B — Fundamentals of Environmental Processes": "Course: ESCI 100B — Fundamentals of Environmental Processes\nCredits: 5\nDescription: Quantitative exploration of physical and chemical processes relevant to the environment and their applications to complex environmental systems. Focuses on calculus-based tools. Key concepts include fluid mechanics, heat transfer, mass transfer, particle mechanics, turbulence, and physicochemical processes. (Formerly offered as Introduction to Environmental Processes.)\nRequirements: Requirements Prerequisite(s): ESCI 100A , and MATH 11B or MATH 19B , and CHEM 3C or CHEM 4B or CHEM 1C , and PHYS 6B or PHYS 5B . Enrollment is restricted to declared environmental sciences majors.",
    "ESCI 122 — Air Pollution": "Course: ESCI 122 — Air Pollution\nCredits: 5\nDescription: Introduces students to the chemistry and physics of air pollution with primary emphasis on understanding the main types of air pollutants, from where they originate, how they are removed, how to control their sources, measurement techniques, and their health effects.\nRequirements: Requirements Prerequisite(s): ESCI 100A or EART 110A .",
    "ESCI 150 — Field and Laboratory Methods in Coastal and Aquatic Science": "Course: ESCI 150 — Field and Laboratory Methods in Coastal and Aquatic Science\nCredits: 5\nDescription: Students become familiar with some of the core measurement and sampling techniques routinely employed by working aquatic scientists. In keeping with the multi-disciplinary nature of aquatic science, these techniques and measurements include those taken from biology, geology, chemistry and physics. The overarching goal of is having students become deeply familiar with a field site and observing it over an extended period of time while working collaboratively to accomplish all the measurements. The field component of the work is conducted at UCSC's Younger Lagoon Research Reserve, located adjacent to the Long Marine Lab on the coastal campus. Taught in conjunction with OCEA 250 ; students cannot receive credit for this course and OCEA 250 .\nRequirements: Requirements Prerequisite(s): CHEM 3C , CHEM 4B , or CHEM 1C , and PHYS 5B or PHYS 6B , and MATH 11B or MATH 19B , and ESCI 30 or BIOE 20C .",
    "ESCI 160 — Data Analysis in the Environmental Sciences": "Course: ESCI 160 — Data Analysis in the Environmental Sciences\nCredits: 5\nDescription: Introduces data-analysis methods regularly encountered within environmental sciences. Students learn how to think about data, its uncertainty, how models and data are related and depend on underlying assumptions, and how to synthesize information contained in data.\nRequirements: Requirements Prerequisite(s): MATH 11B or MATH 19B or equivalent. Enrollment is restricted to declared environmental sciences majors.",
    "ESCI 167 — Applied Environmental Time Series Analysis": "Course: ESCI 167 — Applied Environmental Time Series Analysis\nCredits: 5\nDescription: Explores empirical approach to quantify and explain changes in the Earth system over time. With the complexity of the Earth system, and the challenge of making accurate and numerous observations, simple methods can be of limited usefulness. Course covers more advanced methods that are typically not included in introductory-level statistical courses. Students learn how to analyze time-series data and answer questions about the Earth system and acquire the theoretical basis of the statistical approaches, the experience at conducting analyses, and practice interpreting and discussing the results. This class is hands-on and utilizes a suite of observational datasets and outputs from Earth system models. Students cannot receive credit for this course and OCEA 267 .\nRequirements: Requirements Prerequisite(s): ESCI 160 , EART 125 , or OCEA 260 /EART 260.",
    "ESCI 191 — Capstone Seminar": "Course: ESCI 191 — Capstone Seminar\nCredits: 5\nDescription: In-depth exploration of a topic within the environmental sciences. Involves at least one research paper. Topics vary quarterly; consult the current course listings. Prerequisite(s): Entry Level Writing and Composition requirements; ESCI 100A and previous or concurrent enrollment in ESCI 100B . Enrollment is restricted to senior environmental sciences majors. Enrollment is by application with selection based on appropriate background and academic performance and by consent of the instructor. Satisfies the senior comprehensive requirement.\nRequirements: No additional requirements listed.",
    "ESCI 195 — Senior Thesis": "Course: ESCI 195 — Senior Thesis\nCredits: 5\nDescription: Students complete their senior thesis research projects and submit their thesis in the form of a research paper that is appropriate for submission to a relevant journal or conference. Prerequisite(s): Entry Level Writing and Composition requirement. Enrollment is restricted to environmental sciences majors.Satisfies the senior comprehensive requirement. Students submit petition to sponsoring agency.\nRequirements: No additional requirements listed."
