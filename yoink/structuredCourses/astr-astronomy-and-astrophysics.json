By needing to communicate the important aspects of conducting research, communicating results, and maintaining research integrity, students cultivate and strengthen their own values as a researcher. This is a continuing class that spans both winter and spring quarters, for a total of 10 credits. Because research projects will span both quarters, students must enroll in both quarters.
