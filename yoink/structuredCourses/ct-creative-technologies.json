      "description": "Online community colloquium on topics in contemporary creativity and creative practices. How does creative work address its most challenging problems, both in the arts and in broader social and professional contexts? How does creative labor intersect with other forms of labor to address power and inequity in society? Guest lecturers address the critical contextsâincluding racism, ableism, patriarchy, and other structures of powerâfor cultural work, and how those contexts, which are inseparable from the discipline of art-making and curation in 21st-century technological contexts, can be transformed.
