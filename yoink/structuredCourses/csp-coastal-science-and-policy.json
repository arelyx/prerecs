Sessions primarily involve peer-review and feedback on student progress in planning their individual Coastal Science and Policy (CSP) capstone project. The capstone project must engage with a real-world partner(s) on a scalable opportunity for solving a critical problem in coastal areas (from land to sea). Faculty lead mini-lectures as needed. Course stresses learning-by-doing: weekly assignments have students work outside of class on steps or skills in the design process and then the student shares their work in the following class to gain peer insights. Students should expect to do the reading and a substantial assignment each week BEFORE the class session meets.",

Methods learned apply broadly to collaborative, solutions-oriented work that may be pursued after graduation. Weekly assignments mean working outside of class on steps or skills for co-creating and fundraising with partners and then sharing work for peer-review in class in the next week.
