Mentors engage with recent research and practice evidence-based strategies that help historically marginalized students excel in science through an equity-centered approach. To apply insights from educational research, mentors create mentoring statements that articulate their equity values and the specific strategies they use to enact equity in mentoring. Enrollment is by permission of instructor and prioritizes graduate students in STEM or Social Science discipline. Contact the instructor for a permission code. The instructor will review enrollees as needed to ensure priority is being met. Postdoctoral scholars in these fields may audit the course.",

To put the insights of educational research into practice, GSIs create the essential components of an original college-level course, including course learning outcomes, assessment plans, an equity-minded syllabus, and an engaging course structure. First priority of enrollment is given to graduate students who have been appointed to teach as GSIs in the upcoming summer sessions. Open on a space-available basis to all other graduate students.",
