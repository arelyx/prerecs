      "description": "Remote sensing is the study of the Earth's land, water, atmospheric and human-made features using imaging devices on both airborne and spaceborne platforms. The course includes the study of electromagnetic energy and the methods used to extract useful information from remotely sensed images. Students develop a strong understanding of the tools and techniques used to display, process, and analyze remotely sensed data as well as develop analytical workflows to derive remotely sensed products for a broad range of applications. Lab work involves image interpretation using aerial photographs and computer-based digital image processing.",

      "description": "Introduction to the foundational concepts, techniques, and skills of computer programming needed to tackle complex analyses and automate geoprocessing workflows in a geographic information system (GIS). Emphasis is on object-oriented programming and developing basic programming skills using the Python scripting language. Students learn essential programming concepts needed for processing spatial data variables and expressions, data typing, data structures, conditional branching, looping, functions, input/output, data manipulation, and debugging. Students also develop geoprocessing programs to edit, query, manipulate, and analyze spatial data (both vector and raster data) with ArcPy and other modules like NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas. No prior programming experience is required.",
