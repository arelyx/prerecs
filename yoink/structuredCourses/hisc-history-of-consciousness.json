      "description": "What does it mean to speak of consciousness in an age of AI, ecological crisis, and future uncertainty? Can âraising consciousnessâ result in meaningful social change? Or is human consciousness an obstacle to be overcome? This course examines the history of the concept of consciousness within the Western philosophical tradition, focusing on its relationship to political action. Students are introduced to major debates in the fields of phenomenology, political philosophy, and philosophy of mind. Readings include Descartes, Hegel, Marx, Husserl, Sartre, Fanon, Merleau-Ponty, and Thao.",

This class introduces Marxâs fundamental ideas about labor, nature, and capital, with a focus on the ecological dimensions of his thinking. It also examines current Marxist perspectives on ecological crisis and their convergence with ecofeminist, anti-colonial, and Indigenous standpoints.",

This course explores the concept and theories of democracy, with a focus on the âPeopleââwho constitutes the people, how popular will is embodied, and how it may be expressed. Course explores debates about different models of democracy and examines how alternatives to democracy, such as dictatorship, autocracy, and tyranny, have been conceptualized. Also studies democracy and its âothersâ in relation to a constellation of concepts including power, equality, participation, accountability, resistance, legitimacy, and the rule of law.",

Side by side with the theorists of resistance, the course analyzes examples of resistance from around the world, traversing different time periods, geographies, and cultures. Examples range from peasant revolts to labor movements, feminist struggles to anti-war mobilizations, prisoner uprisings to anti-colonial wars and contemporary forms of corporeal, self-sacrificial resistance. Relying upon the concrete political problems posed by each historical instance as springboards into larger theoretical concerns, the course focuses on questions such as the nature of power relations, different forms of political organization and representation, the relationship between means and ends, the role of violence, and the function of different media, especially as they become manifest in the complexity of real politics.",

Analyzing the historically recent genesis and differentiation of categories like “religion,” “politics,” and “science,” course examines how the rise to prominence of “belief” is constitutive of modernity as a whole. From these theoretical-historical foundations, course goes on to explore the realms of so-called belief themselves, through case studies on the bodily practices of mystics, prophetically inspired peasant uprisings, and the uncanny reality of UFOs.

How are we to live, and who are we to become, in an age of ecological unraveling? What is to be done in the realms of politics and culture to ensure a livable future?

      "description": "Examines modern humanism and its critics in a trajectory composed of three moments: foundational texts of 19th century humanism and some of their 20th century interpreters, the critiques of humanism launched by structuralist/post-structuralist continental theory in the 1960s that dealt with the essentialization of the human (theoretical anti-humanism), and contemporary critiques that take issue with anthropocentrism (posthumanism/transhumanism). Students consider thematics that have shaped humanism and the controversies surrounding it including questions of secularism, morality, and materialism, essentialism and class/gender/racial identity, anthropocentrism, and universalism. Readings include Feuerbach, Marx, Sartre, Heidegger, Foucault, Althusser, Haraway, Braidotti, and Ferrando.",

Amid anxieties for the planetâs future, we give attention to tensions between place-based ecological attachments and the perpetuation of nativist and nationalist exclusions, and to how Earth, land, and soil world-makings may appear uneven, unequal and divergent, common and uncommon, as well as inevitably interdependent.",
