      "name": "CRES 206 — Studying with Ancestors",
      "description": "This seminar is an experiment in reclaiming a small patch of the university as a space for studying with ancestors. Reflects on how practices of ancestral relation have informed anti-colonial rebellions and subsequent struggles against racial capitalism. Also investigates how European colonial modernity reproduces itself through the brutal regulation of ancestral knowledge. A transnational archive of art, seed, film, and social theory guides students in thinking collectively about their own practices of studyâand how they might channel or divert the currents of the past.",
