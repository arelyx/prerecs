Modern translation systems learn to translate by reading millions of words of already translated text. This course covers the models and algorithms used by such systems and explains how they are able to automatically translate one human language to another. The course covers fundamental building blocks using concepts from linguistics, statistical and deep machine learning, algorithms, and data structures. It provides insight into the challenges associated with machine translation and introduces novel approaches that might lead to better machine translation systems.",
