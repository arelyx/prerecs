Noise can be negative, disruptive, painful, annoying, or it can be transgressive, liberating, rebellious, and a critical expression of resistance. Noise can take on many forms: metaphorical, silent, visual, dissonant, literary, quiet or loud. Course focuses on modernist and postmodernist techniques and discourses, traversing many practices from how noise and silence have been used as weapons, to experimental art music, punk rock, death metal, Japanoise, improvised music, and electronic glitch amongst others in order to trace how noise has been harnessed as a tool for disruption.",
