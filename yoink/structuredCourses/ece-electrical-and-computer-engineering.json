Its large environmental as well as economic footprint make it a target of many environmental policies, as well as an inherently interesting sector to study. The recent development of energy and climate policy at the global, the U.S. federal, and state-level has made Energy & Climate Policy an intriguing and dynamic topic for both industries and academia. This course will present fundamental analytical tools (optimization and simulation) for modeling firm and market behavior for the energy sector, with a focus on electric power. However, these models can be used for planning investments in generation, transmission, and energy conservation, and for analysis of public policy.",
